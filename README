Automaton is a simple pure Ruby implementation of automata. It makes it easy to create, modify and visualize utomata. See also http://www.jklm.no/automaton.

===== Dependencies
Automaton depends on the rtex gem, which is used to generate latex for illustrations. To generate images, a working Latex installation is also required. 

===== Origin 
Automaton was written as a part of my final year project which used automata to model the semantics of a programming language.

===== License
Automaton is licenced under the MIT-license. See LICENSE.
