Automaton is a simple pure Ruby implementation of automata. It makes it easy to create, modify and visualize utomata.

===== Dependencies
Automaton does not have any required dependencies, but Latex is needed if you want to generate drawings from the tex output.


===== Origin 
Automaton was written as a part of my final year project which used automata to model the semantics of a programming language.

===== License
Automaton is licenced under the MIT-license. (highly permissive, BSD-style)
